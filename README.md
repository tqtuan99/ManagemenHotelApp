## Concept üßê

In the era of technology 4.0 with advanced science and technology, applying hotel management website to business activities is extremely important, urgent and extremely easy for users. With growing tourism services, hotel chains are no exception in applying technology, especially in management. In fact, there have been many hotels that have successfully applied technology in remote management and achieved results above expectations. However, besides that, there are still quite a few hotels and resorts that have not yet applied these technologies but still do it manually or cannot operate effectively. Therefore, this website was born to serve hotel administrators who can manage the personnel and activities of the hotel.
